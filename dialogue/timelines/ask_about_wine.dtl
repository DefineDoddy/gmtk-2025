Action: [i]You swirl the wine in your glass, savoring the aroma before taking a sip.[/i]
You: This is really excellent wine. Who picked it out?
Evelyn: I did, actually. I wanted something special for tonight. It’s from a small vineyard I visited last year.
Sophie: Well it's a good choice, Evelyn. I helped Thomas bring up the bottles earlier. I almost dropped one - would’ve been a tragedy.
Lucas: I just drink whatever’s poured. But I have to admit, this is a step up from my usual.
Jasper: It’s nice. Smooth. I noticed the label - very old. Must be expensive.
Thomas: Miss Evelyn was very particular about the selection. She keeps a fine cellar indeed.
